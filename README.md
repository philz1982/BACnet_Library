# BACnet_Library- Update 3-30-2016
This project is a Java interpreation of the BACnet Standard. It will include BACnet/IP, BACnet/MSTP, and a 
BACnet Server/Client Demo application.

The original source code comes from the C# YABE (Yet Another BACnet Explorer) code off of Sourceforge at 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/yetanotherbacnetexplorer/

My Plan is as follows
1. Copy the C# source files to Java Files - Complete
2. Modify the Java Classes to be executable code
3. Create a data access layer to store data
4. Add a server class and service to host BACnet objects
5. Build a MVC UI to access the data
6. Build a RESTful API to access the server functions
