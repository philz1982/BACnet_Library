# BACnet_Library- Update 3-30-2016
This project is a Java interpreation of the BACnet Standard. It will include BACnet/IP, BACnet/MSTP, and a 
BACnet Server/Client Demo application.

The original source code comes from the C# YABE (Yet Another BACnet Explorer) code off of Sourceforge at 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/yetanotherbacnetexplorer/

## My Plan is as follows
* Copy the C# source files to Java Files - Complete
* Modify the Java Classes to be executable code
* Create a data access layer to store data
* Add a server class and service to host BACnet objects
* Build a MVC UI to access the data
* Build a RESTful API to access the server functions
